##1. Project Idea
We feel this wonderful world with our senses. We experience the warm of sunny days and the depression of cloudy days, we witness the miracle of nature and the wonder of human history. Among all senses, eyes is the most important one that bring us the most intuitive feelings. As the holy bible says:

> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
> </br>-Matthew 6:22

However, millions of people in the world are suffering the sadness and helpless from eye disease, normal people can hardly understand how painful they are.

*Sadness of Eyes* is an interactive website, powered by the technology of [P5](https://p5js.org/), aiming at letting normal people to experience how the world looks like in the eye of eye disease patients, and also letting them to know how unconvenient those patients' life is.

In our project, we let users to experience 3 different eye diseases: short-sight, color-blindness and night-blindness. In each part, user will face a game challenge that they are required to finish a task if they are eye disease patient. Users will find difficulties to finish the task, thus to stimulate empathy of them.

##2. Challenges
Since we are normal people that can never know how the world looks like in the eye of eye disease patients, we have consulted a lot of relevant literature and images. These references can help us to simulate the world in the eyes of the patient.

For example, the world can performed in different ways according to different kinds of color-blindenss:

Another challenges is how to design some games to let people feel the difficulties of patients life. The games should not only be revelant to the disease, but also interesting and attractive, we need to find the balance between them.

##3. Difficulties
  - We need to simplify the logic of the game we've designed, so that we can use the [P5](https://p5js.org/) knowledge we've learned to achieve it. So we need to ensure that the original intention of the game is fully presented, on the other hand the solution should be as simple as possible to achieve.
  - In our program, some functions are needed but never been taught on class, such as *setTimeout*, *createVideo*, etc. We need to search them on the web, and learn on our own. It's not only hard to learn, but also how to use them well.
  - The final work is a comprehensive use of the knowledge we have learned in the course, and we need to master it before we can use them well, especially the *if* statement. We need to check many references to make sure the function works.
